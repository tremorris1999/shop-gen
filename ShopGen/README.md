# ShopGen (web)

To run the web app, I would personally recommend [Bun](https://bun.sh) for your runtime and package manager. Bun has the capacity to install packages up to 100x faster on linux. Bun also supports typescript and JSX/TSX fresh out of the box without configuration.

## Run

```sh
#Bun
bun i && bun run dev

#npm (not reccommended)
npm i && npm run dev
```
